    <h1>OPTIMIZIZING SOLAR ENERGY IN RURAL AREAS</h1>
    <figure>
        <p>In rural areas, limited awareness about solar energy's potential contributes to ongoing challenges such as high electricity costs and frequent power cuts. 
            we intend to raise awareness about the benefits of solar energy adoption, including its environmental sustainability, long-term viability and potential cost savings.

        The Solar Energy is produced by the Sunlight is a non-vanishing renewable source of energy which is free from ecofriendly. Every hour enough sunlight energy reaches the earth to meet the world’s energy demand for a whole year. In today’s generation we needed Electricity every hour. This Solar Energy is generated by as per applications like industrial, commercial, and residential. It cans easily energy drawn from direct sunlight. So it is very efficiency & free environment pollution for surrounding. In this article, we have reviewed about the Solar Energy from Sunlight and discussed about their future trends and aspects. The article also tries to discussed working, solar panel types; emphasize the various applications and methods to promote the benefits of solar energy.

        <p>Seetharamapuram Village is located in Narasapuram Mandal of West Godavari District in Andhra Pradesh, India. It is situated 6km away from the sub-district headquarters Narasapuram (Tehsildar Office) and 131 km away from the district headquarters Bhimavaram. As per 2009 stats, Seetharamapuram South is the Gram Panchayat of Seetharamapuram Village. The total geographical area of the village is 744 hectares. Seetharamapuram has a total population of 7,461 people. The literacy rate of Seetharamapuram Village is 71.17%, The pin code of Seetharamapuram Village locality is 534280.</p>
<p>Nowadays, due to the decreasing amount of renewable energy resources, the last ten years become more important for per watt cost of solar energy device. It is definitely set to become economical in the coming years and growing as better technology in terms of both cost and applications. Everyday earth receives sunlight above (1366W approx.) This is an unlimited source of energy which is available at no cost. The major benefit of solar energy over other conventional power generators is that the sunlight can be directly converted into solar energy with the use of smallest photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. There have been a large amount of research activities to combine the Sun’s energy process by developing solar cells/panels/module with high converting form. the most advantages of solar energy is that it is free reachable to common people and available in large quantities of supply compared to that of the price of various fossil fuels and oils in the past ten years. Moreover, solar energy requires considerably lower manpower expenses over conventional energy production technology.

        <p>PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana is a government scheme that aims to provide free electricity to households in India. The scheme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 15, 2024. Under the scheme, households will be provided with a subsidy to install solar panels on their roofs. The subsidy will cover up to 40% of the cost of the solar panels. The scheme is expected to benefit 1 crore households across India. It is estimated that the scheme will save the government Rs. 75,000 crore per year in electricity costs.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <OL>
       <H2> 
        Describe the problems you have identified in the community</H2>
        
        As large number of people are living in a specified area, there may so many problems they are facing. Some of them are described here: <br><br>
       <li> 
        Lack of Access to Reliable Electricity: seetharampuaram village as lack access to reliable electricity from the grid. This can be due to insufficient infrastructure or geographic challenges that make grid extension costly or impractical. As a result, villagers often experience frequent power outages or have no access to electricity at all, impacting their daily lives and economic activities.</li>
        
        <li> Cost High On  Traditional Fuels: In the absence of electricity, villagers often rely on traditional fuels such as kerosene, firewood, or biomass for lighting, cooking, and heating. These fuels can be expensive, inefficient, and environmentally harmful. Indoor air pollution from burning these fuels also poses health risks, particularly to women and children who spend more time indoors.</li>
        
        <li> Limited Power for Basic Needs: Even in villages connected to the grid, the electricity supply may be insufficient to meet the basic needs of residents. Power shortages can affect essential services such as lighting, refrigeration for storing food and medicines, and powering small appliances like fans or televisions. This limits educational opportunities, hampers economic productivity, and affects overall quality of life.</li>
        
        <li>High Energy Costs: For villages connected to the grid, the cost of electricity may be prohibitively high for many residents, especially those with low incomes. High energy costs can exacerbate poverty and inequality, as households are forced to allocate a significant portion of their income to pay for basic energy needs.</li>
        
        <li>Vulnerability to Natural Disasters: Villages in disaster-prone areas may face additional energy challenges due to the susceptibility of traditional energy infrastructure to damage from natural disasters such as storms, floods, or earthquakes. Disruptions to energy supply can hamper relief efforts and exacerbate the impact of disasters on communities.</li>
        
        
        
        </OL>
    <h2>Short-term and long-term action plan for possible solutions for the problems identified and that could be recommended to the concerned authorities for implementation.
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Solar installation is important in villages because it provides a reliable and sustainable source of electricity. In many villages, access to electricity from the grid may be limited or unreliable, making it difficult for residents to power lights, appliances, and other essential devices. Solar panels capture sunlight and convert it into electricity, which can be used to light homes, charge phones, run small appliances, and more. Since sunlight is abundant and renewable, solar energy helps villagers save money on energy bills while reducing their dependence on fossil fuels. Additionally, solar installations contribute to a cleaner environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Overall, solar installation improves the quality of life in villages by providing access to clean, affordable, and reliable electricity for daily needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>CONCLUSIONS:- </h2>
        <p>

            This community service project is to approach to empower rural 
            communities with solar power.Awareness campaigns, through 
            workshops, informative pamphlets, and school integration, aim to 
            educate villagers about the benefits of this clean energy source, 
            clarify misconceptions and generating interest.Additionally, 
            advocating for government schemes and exploring microloans can 
            make solar solutions financially accessible for rural 
            households.This project has the potential to create a lasting 
            positive impact, develops a shift towards more sustainable future. 
            By raising awareness, demonstrating feasibility, and facilitating 
            access, we can empower rural communities to make informed 
            decisions regarding their energy needs. The success of this project 
            can be achieved by the support of local authorities who can help 
            ease the permitting processes and advocate for policies that 
            encourage solar adoption.By implementing these solutions, we 
            can  effectively empower rural communities to drive them towards 
            sustainable post-convention ,renewable freely available Solar 
            energy.
